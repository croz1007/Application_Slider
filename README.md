Application_Slider
==================

This application slider is built using jQuery UI and images. It will dynamically adjust the slider control to move the correct increments based on the total width of the images used in the content-holder. You links and images can be loaded directly from your database. The links are hardcoded in this code as an example.

I have included the PSD file for the images used and the gradient background. Feel free to use the file to add your own images when using this code. Currently, the height of the control is coded based on a 250px height for the link images. This can be made to handle the max height of the images used in the container making this even more flexible.

Love to hear your feedback, comments, suggestions, or questions.

Thanks

Brian
